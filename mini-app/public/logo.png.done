A stylized logo for the Crypto Goal Tracker app. The logo should feature a simple, clean design that combines a cryptocurrency symbol (such as a stylized coin or a stylized graph arrow) with a checkmark or progress bar to represent goal tracking. The background should be a solid, light blue color. The coin or graph should be in a contrasting dark blue or black, and the checkmark should be in a bright green. The overall composition should be balanced and centered, with the logo text “Crypto Goal Tracker” written in a modern sans‑serif font below the graphic, in dark blue. The image should be clear, high‑resolution, and suitable for use as a website favicon and app icon.
