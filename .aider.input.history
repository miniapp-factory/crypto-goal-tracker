+Crypto Goal Tracker — App Description
+
+Create a simple mini app called “Crypto Goal Tracker”.
+The app helps users set and track their personal crypto-related goals.
+No internet access or external data is required — all information is entered manually by the user.
+
+Core Features
+ 1. A text input field for the user to enter a goal name (e.g., “Save 0.5 ETH”, “Buy 10 SOL”).
+ 2. A numeric input field to set a target amount.
+ 3. A numeric input field to enter the current progress amount.
+ 4. A button “Add Goal” that saves the goal to a list.
+ 5. A visible list displaying all added goals in a clean layout:
+ • Goal name
+ • Target amount
+ • Current progress
+ • Progress percentage
+ 6. A “Update Progress” button for each goal, opening a small dialog where the user can enter a new progress value.
+ 7. A “Delete” button for each goal to remove it.
+
+How the app should work
+ • User enters a goal name, target, and current progress.
+ • Presses “Add Goal”, and the goal appears in the list.
+ • The app calculates the progress percentage automatically (current ÷ target × 100).
+ • User can update progress anytime using the built-in update dialog.
+ • User can delete goals from the list.
+ • All data lives inside the app session and requires no external API.
+
+UI Requirements
+ • Inputs placed at the top in a clean form layout.
+ • Goals displayed below in a simple table or cards.
+ • Progress percentage should update immediately after any change.
+ • Buttons and labels must be clearly marked.
+
+Goal of the App
+
+Provide users with a simple, offline-friendly way to track personal crypto accumulation goals without any external integrations.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
